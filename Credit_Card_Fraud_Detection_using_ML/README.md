# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
====================================================
## Overview
Welcome to the Credit Card Fraud Detection project! This repository contains a comprehensive machine learning solution designed to identify fraudulent transactions in credit card data. With the increasing prevalence of online transactions, ensuring the security of financial data is more critical than ever. This project aims to provide an effective method for detecting fraudulent activities using advanced machine learning techniques.

## Project Description
This project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to analyze credit card transaction data and classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. The main objectives include:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis.
2. Model Training: Implementing different machine learning models to find the best fit.
3. Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Technologies Used
1. Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and model building.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. NumPy: For numerical computations.
4. Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms.
5. Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.
6. Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding and documentation.

## Dataset
- The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.
- It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

## Results
The project demonstrates the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting fraudulent transactions.
Key metrics achieved include:
- Accuracy: 98.5%
- Precision: 95%
- Recall: 90%
- F1-Score: 92.5%

Visualizations of model performance and confusion matrices are included in the notebook for better understanding.
